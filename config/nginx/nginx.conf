# worker_processes controls the number of forked Nginx processes handling
# requests, general 1-2x the number of processors is a good choice.
# worker_connections controls the number of connections each process takes, so
# the total max connections is (worker_connections * worker_processes).
#
# Nginx can handle a *lot* more connections than an equivalent Apache, so the
# 400 total connections here isn't out of line for a small virtual machine.
